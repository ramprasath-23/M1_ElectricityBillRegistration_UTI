#RESEARCH

People who donâ€™t have technical knowledge of calculating electricity bill can use this application to predict electricity bill of upcoming months, however, the defining features of an electricity bill calculator include:

1)power rating of all loads
2)total load calculation
3)unit consumed per day
4)units consumed per month
In addition, high-end electricity bill calculators generally include:

1)electricity bill calculation in urban areas
2)electricity bill calculation in rural areas
